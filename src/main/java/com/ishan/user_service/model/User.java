/**
 * ✅ WHY we changed ID generation from IDENTITY -> TABLE (MySQL + bulk insert optimization)
 *
 * PROBLEM WITH GenerationType.IDENTITY (what we had earlier):
 * - In IDENTITY, the database generates the ID at insert time (AUTO_INCREMENT).
 * - Hibernate MUST insert the row immediately to get the generated ID back.
 * - Because of that, Hibernate cannot batch inserts properly.
 *
 * RESULT:
 * - Even if we set: hibernate.jdbc.batch_size=1000
 * - Hibernate still executes 1 INSERT per row (no JDBC batching)
 * - This is why bulk insert was slow and Hibernate stats showed:
 *   "executing 0 JDBC batches"
 *
 * ✅ WHY TABLE strategy helps:
 * - TABLE strategy uses a separate table to generate IDs.
 * - Hibernate can pre-allocate IDs in bulk BEFORE inserting rows.
 * - Example: allocationSize=1000
 *   -> Hibernate asks once: "Give me next 1000 IDs"
 *   -> Then it can insert 1000 users in a batch without waiting for DB IDs per row.
 *
 * ✅ WHAT TableGenerator does here:
 * - Creates/uses a table: id_generator
 * - Stores last used ID for different entities (gen_name -> gen_value)
 * - For User, we use key "user_id"
 *
 * ✅ PERFORMANCE BENEFIT:
 * - Enables true JDBC batching in MySQL
 * - Faster bulk inserts (less DB round-trips)
 * - Lower memory pressure + better throughput when inserting millions of records
 *
 * ⚠️ TRADE-OFFS / Notes:
 * - IDs can have gaps (normal in batch allocation).
 * - Requires the id_generator table to exist/manage values.
 * - TABLE is not as fast as SEQUENCE (Postgres), but in MySQL it's the best batching-friendly option.
